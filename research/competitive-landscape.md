## MKE.dev Differentiation

### Unique Feature Combination

| Feature | MKE.dev | Zoning AI Chat | My Zoning AI | City Chatbots |
|---------|---------|----------------|--------------|---------------|
| Voice-first (Gemini Live) | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Interactive map + chat | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Click parcel → AI context | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| RAG on actual zoning PDFs | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Grounded citations | ✅ | Partial | ❌ | ❌ |
| Generative UI cards | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Local ESRI integration | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | Varies |
| Homes for sale data | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Vision AI (roadmap) | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

### Key Differentiators

1. **Voice-First Interface**
   - Gemini Live API integration
   - No other zoning app offers voice interaction
   - Accessibility advantage

2. **Map-Chat Integration**
   - Bidirectional: click map → chat context, chat → map highlights
   - Real Milwaukee ESRI layers (zoning, TIF, opportunity zones)
   - Parcel-level precision

3. **Grounded AI Responses**
   - RAG on actual Milwaukee Zoning Code (Chapter 295)
   - Citations with page numbers
   - In-app PDF viewer for verification

4. **Generative UI**
   - Rich cards for zoning info, homes, incentives
   - Not just text responses

## Market Opportunity

### Gap in the Market
- **No US city** has deployed a voice-first, map-integrated zoning AI
- Existing tools are either:
  - Text-only chatbots (Zoning AI Chat)
  - Report-based services (My Zoning AI)
  - General city chatbots (Denver's Sunny)
  - Research prototypes (Civic Atlas)

### Potential for Expansion
- MKE.dev architecture could be replicated for other cities
- Each city has public ESRI/GIS data and zoning codes
- Voice-first + map integration is a defensible differentiator

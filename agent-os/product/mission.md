## Vision Statement

To democratize access to Milwaukee's civic development information by transforming complex zoning codes, financial incentives, and regulatory data into a single, intuitive, voice-first conversational experience—making development knowledge accessible to everyone, regardless of technical expertise or ability.

---

## The Problem

Milwaukee's civic development ecosystem is a labyrinth of fragmented information, creating significant barriers for all stakeholders:

- **Information Overload**: Critical data on zoning, financial incentives, and development permits is buried within hundreds of pages of dense PDFs and scattered across dozens of disparate municipal websites.

- **Accessibility Barriers**: Text-heavy, non-compliant PDFs and websites are largely inaccessible to visually impaired residents.

- **Knowledge Gap**: The system favors insiders with specialized knowledge, while homeowners, small developers, and community members struggle to understand what they can build.

- **Inefficiency**: Developers and architects spend countless hours on manual code-checking, cross-referencing multiple documents, and navigating complex approval processes.

- **Inequity**: Projects are delayed or derailed, preventing citizens and businesses from leveraging opportunities that could benefit their communities.

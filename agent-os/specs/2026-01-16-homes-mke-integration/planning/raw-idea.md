# Raw Idea: Homes MKE Integration

Integrate the Homes_MKE_Properties ESRI FeatureServer into MKE.dev to allow users to ask about homes for sale via chat, see homes highlighted on the map, and view detailed property cards. Include weekly cron job to sync data from ESRI, new agent tools for searching homes, a new map layer with highlight capability, and a HomeCard UI component.

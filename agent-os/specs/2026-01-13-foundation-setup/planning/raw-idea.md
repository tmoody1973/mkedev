# Raw Idea: Foundation Week 1 Setup

## Feature Description

Foundation Week 1 includes the core infrastructure and setup for the MKE.dev platform, encompassing three major areas:

### 1. Project Setup
Initialize Next.js 15, Convex, Clerk

### 2. Mapbox Integration
Mapbox integration with ESRI zoning/parcel layers

### 3. Core Document Ingestion Pipeline
Firecrawl → Gemini File Search

## Context

This is part of Phase 0, Week 1 (Days 1-7) of the hackathon sprint with a deadline of February 10, 2026. These are all P0 (highest priority) features that establish the foundation for all subsequent development.

## Dependencies

- Project Setup has no dependencies (must be completed first)
- Mapbox Integration depends on App Shell (which depends on Design System)
- Document Ingestion has no dependencies (can be done in parallel)
